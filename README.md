# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Building a portfolio using the bootstrap library

## Description 

What I have done in this project:

- Rebuilt my portfolio with the Bootstrap library to include the following components: Navigation bar, Hero section, Work section, Skill section, About Me / Contact section and a Footer section.
- HTML elements have been used following a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- Images contain accessible alt attributes
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
- When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a photo of me, and links to sections about my work, skills I expect to use as a developer, about me and how to contact me and a link to my resume.
- By clicking any of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section, and the navigation collapses into a dropdown menu with links that have the same function. 
- The section including work that I have done, contains bootstrap cards with titled images of applications that I have worked on with buttons that when clicked, will take the user to the deployed applications.
- The first application I worked on has an image that is bigger than the other images (which are currently placeholder images for future projects)
- By clicking the images or the buttons of the cards displaying my applications in the work section, the user is taken to that deployed application.
- If the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.


In order so that:

- I have a portfolio webpage that was quicker to create by using bootstrap that I can use to show the user previous applications that I have worked on
- I can use minimal css code in my stylesheet to obtain practically the same outcome on my webpage
- People visiting my webpage can find ways to contact me or view my social media profiles
- I minimised the need to use of media queries.

This challenge was an exciting way to show off what I've learnt so far in this bootcamp, and an opportunity to work with other students to trouble shoot issues that we were having, and learning how to work through those problems together. By working on this project, I have learnt how useful it is to utilise coding libraries like Bootstrap in order to make building a webpage far more efficient. This has been demonstrated by this challenge taking as little as half the time to finish compared to my previous challenge building a portfolio page from scratch without the help of any libraries.

By selecting any of the links titled "Work", "Skills", and "About Me" located in the top right of the webpage, the user will be directed to the matching sections located elsewhere on the webpage. By selecting the link titled "Resume" in the far top right of the navigation, the user will be directed to my CV in a new tab.

## Features

This is a portfolio webpage built using the Bootstrap libraries. There are page links to navigate the user around the webpage and text hover features that display basic descriptors for the images. There are also various hover features on the cards, buttons, links and icons to make the cursor a pointer, change their colours, enlarge them or give them shadows.
